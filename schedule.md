| --------- | ------------------- |   
| **Overview of Privacy, Security, and Policy** <br> [Clifford Neuman](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Neuman/B) is Associate Professor of Computer Science Practice in the Department of Computer Science at USC, and Director of the Cybersecurity Engineering Program.  He received his bachelor’s degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his MSc and PhD from the University of Washington.  He is well known for being one of the principal authors of the Kerberos authentication system. Kerberos can be used to establish an authenticated communication channel between parties, protecting the integrity of the channel, and optionally protecting the privacy of the communication.  He has been working for many years on computer security, and is currently teaching several courses at USC in this area including DSCI 523 (Computer Systems Assurance), DSCI 529 (Security and Privacy), CSCI 530 (Security Systems), and DSCI 526 (Secure Systems Administration). <br> <a href="Slides-Neuman.pdf">SLIDES | <img src="images/Neuman.jpg" width="500" /> |
| **Privacy Engineering: Goals and Implementation** <br> [Tatyana Ryutov](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Ryutov/Tatyana) is a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science at USC.  She received her PhD degree from USC, and her MSc from Moscow State University.  She has taught courses on information security, computer security policy, trusted system design and development, applied cryptography, operating systems, and computer networks.  She is currently teaching DSCI 534 on Biomedical Data Privacy Issues and Solutions, a new course she developed. <br> <a href="Slides-Ryutov.pdf">SLIDES | <img src="images/Ryutov.jpg" width="500" /> |
| **Data Privacy and Protection in the US** <br> [Michael Orosz](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Orosz/Michael) is Research Director at the USC Information Sciences Institute, and Research Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Spatial Sciences.  He received his bachelor’s degree from the Colorado School of Mines, his MSc degree from the University of Colorado at Boulder, and his PhD degree from UCLA. His research interests focus on behavior-driven decision systems used in operational environments, including data security, cyber crime, homeland security, port security, and intelligent human-computer interfaces. Dr. Orosz has 28+ years experience successfully managing commercial product development and academic research projects.  He currently teaches PPDE 672 Exploration of the Intelligence Community - From Policy to Cyber Espionage in the USC Price School of Policy and Planning. <br> <a href="Slides-Orosz.pdf">SLIDES | <img src="images/Orosz.jpg" width="500" /> |
