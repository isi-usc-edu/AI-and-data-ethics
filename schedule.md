He received his bachelorâ€™s degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his MSc and PhD from the University of Washington.  He is well known for being one of the principal authors of the Kerberos authentication system. Kerberos can be used to establish an authenticated communication channel between parties, protecting the integrity of the channel, and optionally protecting the privacy of the communication.
